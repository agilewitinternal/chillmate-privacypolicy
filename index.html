    <h1>Privacy Policy for "Chillmate"</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 10/22/2024</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The <strong>"Chillmate"</strong> Chrome extension is designed to remind users to take regular breaks and display a timer for their break period. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting any information that you may provide while using this extension. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle data within the extension.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The "Chillmate" extension <strong>does not collect any personal information</strong> or data that can be used to identify or track you. The extension does not transmit any data to external servers, third parties, or remote services.</p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The extension may use <strong>Chrome's local storage</strong> (<code>chrome.storage.local</code>) to store certain settings and preferences related to the functioning of the extension. Specifically, the following data may be stored locally:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>break interval</strong> (the number of minutes before a break reminder).</li>
      <li><strong>Timer settings</strong> for the countdown displayed during a break.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored locally on your device and is <strong>not shared</strong> or transmitted over the internet.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requires the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alarms</strong>: To set reminders for your breaks.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: To notify you when it's time to take a break.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage</strong>: To save and retrieve your preferred break interval locally on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Tabs</strong>: To open a new tab for the timer when a break starts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used solely to provide the core functionality of the extension and are not used for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This extension does not integrate with any third-party services, and no data is shared with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You have control over your data. Since the extension only stores settings locally and does not collect or transmit data, you can remove any locally stored data by uninstalling the extension from your browser.</p>

    <h2>Uninstalling the Extension</h2>
    <p>You can uninstall the "Chillmate" extension at any time. When uninstalled, any locally stored preferences or settings will be permanently deleted.</p>
    <p><strong>To uninstall the extension:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open Chrome and go to <code>chrome://extensions/</code>.</li>
      <li>Find the "Chillmate" extension and click the "Remove" button.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Effective Date" at the top of the policy will be updated accordingly. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>
